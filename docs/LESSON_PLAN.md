## Module 1: The Foundation (What is an Option?)
*   **Concept:** Moving from "Owning the Company" to "Owning a Contract."
*   **The Analogy:** The "Real Estate Deposit." You pay a small fee today to lock in a price for a house later. If the house value goes up, your contract becomes very valuable.
*   **Key Lessons:**
    1.  **Rights vs. Obligations:** You have the right to buy/sell, but not the obligation.
    2.  **The Premium:** The price you pay for this right.
    3.  **The Multiplier:** Every contract controls 100 shares ($2.00 option = $200 cost).
*   **Quest:** "Identify the 'Premium' for an Apple contract expiring in 30 days."

## Module 2: The "Up-Bet" (Calls)
*   **Concept:** Profiting when a stock goes up with less capital than buying shares.
*   **Key Lessons:**
    1.  **Strike Price:** Your "Target Price" where profit starts.
    2.  **In-the-Money (ITM) vs. Out-of-the-Money (OTM).**
    3.  **Leverage:** $1,000 stock investment vs. $1,000 option investment.
*   **Quest:** "Predict a $5 rise in Tesla. Select a Call option that would profit by next week."

## Module 3: The "Insurance" & "Down-Bet" (Puts)
*   **Concept:** Making money when markets fall or protecting your portfolio.
*   **Key Lessons:**
    1.  **The Safety Net:** How Puts act like car insurance for your stocks.
    2.  **Shorting vs. Puts:** Limited risk ($0) vs. unlimited risk.
    3.  **Bearish Profit:** Capitalizing on bad news.
*   **Quest:** "Buy a 'Protective Put' for your SPY holdings to limit losses to $500 during a crash."

## Module 4: The Enemies (Time & Volatility)
*   **Concept:** Why options lose value even if the stock doesn't move.
*   **Key Lessons:**
    1.  **Time Decay (Theta):** The "Melting Ice Cube."
    2.  **Expiration:** What happens at Friday 4:00 PM.
    3.  **Implied Volatility (The Crush):** The "Fear Premium" before earnings.
*   **Quest:** "Use the Time Machine slider to see your profit disappear if the stock stays flat for 10 days."
